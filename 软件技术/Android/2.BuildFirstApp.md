# Build your first App

## Create first App

After create your `MyFirstApp`, you can then see the following files:

1. `./app/src/main/java/com.example.myfirstapp/MainActivity`: This is the main activity (the entry point for your app). When you build and run the app, the system launches an instance of this `Activity` and loads its layout.
2. `./app/src/res/layout/activity_main.xml`: This XML file defines the layout for the activity's UI. It contains a `TextView` element with the text "Hello world!".
3. `./app/src/AndroidManifest.xml`: The [manifest file](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html) describes the fundamental characteristics of the app and defines each of its components.
4. `./app/build.gradle`: You'll see two files with this name: one for the project and one for the "app" module. Each module has its own `build.gradle` file, but this project currently has just one module. You'll mostly work with the module's `build.gradle` file to configure how the Gradle tools compile and build your app. For more information about this file, see [Configure Your Build](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/index.html).

## Run your app

### Run on a real device

Set up your devices as follows:

1. Connect your device to your development machine with a USB cable. If you're developing on Windows, you might need to [install the appropriate USB driver](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb.html) for your device.

2. 然后 Google The Error Message，xjb 动一下就连上了。

### Run on a emulator

Run the app on an emulator as follows:

1. In Android Studio, click the **app** module in the **Project** window and then select **Run > Run** (or click **Run**  in the toolbar).
2. 然后点一下就好了。

## Build a simple user interface

The user interface for an Android app is built using a hierarchy of *layouts*([`ViewGroup`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewGroup.html) objects) and *widgets* ([`View`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html) objects).

1. Layouts are containers that control how their child views are positioned on the screen. 
2. Widgets are UI components such as buttons and text boxes.

### Open the Layout Editor

For additional information, see the [introduction to the Layout Editor](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/layout-editor.html#intro).

### Add a text box

Click the view in the design editor. You can now see the **resizing handles** on each corner (squares), and the **constraint anchors** on each side (circles).

### Add a button

### Change the UI strings

Add a string:

1. Open the Project window and then open `app/res/values/strings.xml`.

   This is a [string resources](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html) file where you should specify all your UI strings. Doing so allows you to manage all UI strings in a single location, which makes it easier to find, update, and localize (compared to hard-coding strings in your layout or app code).

2. Click **Open editor** at the top of the editor window. This opens the [Translations Editor](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/translations-editor.html), which provides a simple interface for adding and editing your default strings, and helps keep all your translated strings organized.

3. Click `Add Key` to create a new string as the "hint text" for the text box.

   1. In the **Add Key** dialog, enter "edit_message" for the key name.
   2. Enter "Enter a message" for the value.
   3. Click **OK**.

Apply string:

1. Click the text box in the layout and, if the **Attributes** window isn't already visible on the right, click **Attributes** on the right sidebar.
2. Locate the **text** property (currently set to "Name") and delete the value.
3. Locate the **hint** property and then click **Pick a Resource** to the right of the text box. In the dialog that appears, double-click on **`<your string key>`** from the list.

### Make the text box size flexible
