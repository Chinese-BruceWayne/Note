# Hash Functions

## Overview

A hash function `h(x)` is a map from `n` bits to `m` bits where `m<n`

An output of a hash function is called a **message digest** or a hash value.

A hash function should satisfy the following property:

1. Collision resistance.
2. Second `pre-image` resistance. Given x, if the probability to find $$y \not= x $$ such that $$h(y) = h(x)$$ is negligible, then the function h is called second `pre-image` resistance.
3. `Pre-image` resistance. Given z, if the probability to find x such that $$z = h(x)$$ is negligible, then the function h is called `pre-image` resistance.
