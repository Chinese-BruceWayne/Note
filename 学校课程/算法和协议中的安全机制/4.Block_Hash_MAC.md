# Chapter 4. Design of Block Ciphers, Hash Functions, and MAC

## Block Cipher

property:

- Diffusion: any bits from the input message should affect whole cipher text.
- Confusion: with different key, the cipher message should be completely different.

Requirements of `f`:

- `Nonelinearity`: a minimum distance between `f` and all the linear, affine functions. Resist linear cryptanalysis.
- `Strict Avalanche Criterion(SAC)`: One bit change, resulting in significant changes. Resist differential cryptanalysis.

### DES

`DES` stand for `Data Encryption Standard`.

Spectral properties of S-Box:

- Hadamard transform: $$\displaystyle f(w) = \sum_{x \in F_2^n} (-1)^{f(x) + xw}â€‹$$
- Avalanche transform: $$\displaystyle A(w) = \sum_{x \in F_2^n} (-1)^{f(x) + f(x + w)}$$

Triple-DES: $$C = E_{K_3} (D_{K_2} (E_{K_1}(M)))$$ or $$C = D_{K_3} (E_{K_2} (D_{K_1}(M)))$$

Encryption Modes:

1. Electronic Codebook (`ECB`) Mode => Security risks.
2. Cipher Block Chaining (`CBC`) Mode.
