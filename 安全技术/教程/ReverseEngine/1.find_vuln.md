## Introduction

### Definition

What is Reverse Engineering?

Process of analyzing a subject system to:
- identify the system’s components and their interrelationships and
- create representations of the system in another form or at a higher level of abstraction

### Basic Terms

- **Program** consists of several **procedures**
- **Produce** consists of several **basic blocks**

- **Basic blocks**: maximal sequence of consecutive instructions with two properties:
  - flow of control only enters at the beginning
  - flow of control can only leave at the end (no halting or branching except at end of block)
- **Flow graph** G(V, E):
  - Vertices are basic blocks
  - Edge $$b_i \rightarrow b_j$$ if $$b_i$$ can follow $$b_j$$ immediately in execution

## Mining for Bugs with Graph Database Queries

### Flow Graph Representation

Typical graph representations for code analysis:

- source code &rarr; AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
- AST &rarr; CFG (Control Flow Graph)
- CFG &rarr; PDG (Program Dependence Graph)

Representations have different strengths

- None of these representations can “do it all”:

- Typical query: Find a call to `foo` in a statement where data flow exists to a statement that contains a call to `bar`.
- Creates the need to transition from one graph representation to the other.

- Can’t we get a representation to account for all of these aspects and allow transitions?

### Property Graphs

Use graphs to store graphs instead of table or document.

- Choose a set of start nodes
- Describe where to walk from there
- If it’s possible to walk the graph according to your description, nodes reached by the walk are returned.

### Joern

A platform for code analysis based on code property graphs stored in a graph database.

- Extensible query language
- Scriptable via a python interface (python-joern)

- Shell tools for common operations (joern-tools)

*Requirement*:

- [ANTLRv4](https://www.antlr.org/) Parser Generator &rarr; a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. 
- Apache Commons CLI Command Line Parser
- [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) &rarr;  a graph database management system developed by Neo4j, Inc.

- The Apache Ant build tool.
