## What is CVE?

CVE stands for *Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures*. It is a program launched in 1999 by MITRE, a nonprofit that operates research and development centers sponsored by the federal government, to identify and catalog vulnerabilities in software or firmware into a free “dictionary” for organizations to improve their security.

## What is CNAs?

CNAs are organizations that identify and distributes CVE IDs to researchers and information technology vendors for inclusion in first-time public announcements of new vulnerabilities. They are part of what MITRE and the CVE board have termed a “federated system,” in which dozens of other organizations – 62 at current count – help identify vulnerabilities and assign them an ID number without directly involving MITRE, which is the primary CNA, in the details of the specific vulnerabilities.
